# My software wishlist

This repo contains a set of scripts and configuration files to install and set
up the environment with the programs a need to be present in my working
environment.

There should be an script for each OS to install the required programs in the
`script` directory such as: `./scripts/install/ubuntu_2204.sh`. In that
directory you would also find the script to link/copy the configurations to the
corresponding directory.

## Must have software

A list with programs that I really use in my day to day:
- **git**
- **curl**
- **lazygit**
- **tmux**
- **neovim**
- A good terminal emulator. Lately I am using **Wezterm**
- A good shell: I use both zsh and fish but I think I will stay with **fish**. Also install fisher as package manager and tide to configure the prompt.
- **ripgrep**

- **fd-find**
- **exa**
- **ncdu**
- **stow**: To link config files

  matplotlib, numpy, scipy.

- **QMK**: To manage the key mapping for my keyboard.
- A **Nerd font** (usually Hack).
